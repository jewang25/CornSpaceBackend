# CornSpaceBackend

We have implemented an events table that stores events. There is a tasks table connected the events table that stores the tasks for each event (one to many relationship). In addition, there is a category table to assign the events to categories (many to many relationship). There is also a jokes route that uses an external api to generate random jokes.
